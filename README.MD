# WordPress.org Topic Highlighter

## About the project

This is a userscript, used with TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey, to highlight support topics for plugins and themes on WordPress.org.

It does this by putting them into three actionable categories:
- Resolved topics
- Unresolved topics that are more than a week old
- Unresolved topics, less than a week old, that have yet to receive any response

The view is color-coded to allow you to quickly identify which topics need attention based on your own support criteria.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, bugreports, suggestions and even pull requests! No limitations, shoot for the stars!

The project uses no fancy build procedures, it's all JavaScript and the source is in the `src/` directory
